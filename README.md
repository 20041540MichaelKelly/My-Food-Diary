Introduction<br>
The app that I have created is based on a log for food, you can create your own log entries to monitor intake, you can edit or delete the food item in the list or search for food items that contains the title or part of the title. When you create a food item you can add title, you can add a description, location as to where the food was consumed or purchased and an image that can be chosen from your images or a new feature, I implemented the ability to take a picture and use that image. All these will be displayed in the list, this list will be populated by the user logged in or a switch can be turned on that allows users to view other peopleâ€™s entries because at the end of the day that is its purpose to gain ideas and knowledge on food, while viewing other people entries you cannot edit these entries, this is done by checking the firebase users id to the associated foodItem.uid. Also, there is additional links in the navigation that will bring the user to vast array of food items from all over the world. The other link is the map fragment that will display all locations added with food details. There is a QR scanner that can scan and get data on the food, also bar codes can be scanned. You can filter the Food Ideas, by Max calories and how many items you would like returned to view.

The 3rd party applications that I have implemented in my project are<br>
1.firebase<br>
2. (Spoonacular)<br>
3. Google sign in<br>
4. Camera<br>
5. Google Maps<br>
6. ZXing Library<br>

Firebase<br>
I have implemented a real time database from firebase that uses authentication for the user to create user or to login. Then the Id from this is being used in the authentication process is stored in a separate database called user-food, there is also a food database that is just a map of all the details stored for the food item object. So, the user-database is used the most as it is to check the credentials of the user and retrieve the correct data. This is done by referencing the database and having liveFireBaseUser that retrieves the userid that can be compared and then validated against the data stored.

Google sign in<br>
This is achieved my implementing this into the grade.build and then creating a onClickListener that starts up the list of available Google accounts on the phone if there are any. This is convenient as your account will be auto generated from existing credentials associated with your Google account.<br>

Spoonaculiar (Free API)<br>
This is a free API to a certain extent depending on how many calls are made a day. that I am using with the app so the user can retrieve food items from all over the world, this will give the user the option of filtering through the data to find what they are looking for but also to add this to their own food log as a food they might like to try. This then will be stored in the firebase food database associated with the user logged in. It will display images and title and description and calories. basically, everything that our database stores.

The Camera<br>
I decided to implement this feature for the user to be able to capture their own images of food or whatever as it would be inconvenient to have to open another app to take a photo of food, why not allow the user to do it in this app also. The image then will be stored just like the image that can be chosen from existing images.

Google Maps<br>
This is used twice in the project, as it is used to choose the location of where the food was eating or where you can purchase the food. This will be stored in the food object that will be stored in the firebase database, there will be a link in the navigation menu where the user can then navigate the map fragment where they can view all the place marks they have added or all the place marks everyone entered read only though.<br>

UX/UI Design<br>
The user experience and design I went with was a simple design and intuitive for the user with self-explanatory navigation, if app is downloaded on the phone first time it will be prompted to sign up by manual or Google which is in line with other modern applications, ease of sign up and login. I tried to base the whole project on ease of use. The less work the user must do to accomplish what they need the better, the food list will load first when signed in as it is nice to review before adding anything extra. It is created with a recycler view that is fed from the firebase database. Then the user can add a foodItem, now this is where I copied amazon's way to be honest. I stead of a scroll view to scroll up and see buttons, I took the scroll view out as They obviously know what works. There nothing fancy about the map activity that adds the location of food. It is just the activity from first project but is re wrote so a fragment can receive the parcelble of location. You have the option of capturing an image or choose an image which is convenient, it is created by using fragments as this is more modular.

Fragments<br>
The first version of this project was created using activities as the framework but in the second part being this project, I have created It on Fragments. Fragments are a convenient way of having multiple activities being controlled from the 1 activity. It makes the application more modular. The process in which these were implemented was by following the labs but then turning to my already implemented activities and then converting them freestyle. The Fragments that I use are for MyFoodDiary page, MyFoodList page, Map page, QR Scanner and Food Ideas page.

Nav Bar<br>
The Nav Bar contains multiple options for the user, and it has its own style in the xml layout but also its own menu layout. This in turn is called from the mothership being the Home Activity. All fragments are referenced in the main navigation menu layout and from here they reference their own individual xml layout files. So, no matter where you are you can bring up the navigation drawer from any of the fragments mentioned above.<br>

My Food List<br>
This is the landing page for the app after the splash screen, this will display a list of food items that can be edited or deleted and/or the list can be added to. On this page you can navigate to anywhere else in the application, you have quick access to My Food Diary from the Floating action Button. From the Nav Drawer you have access to the MyFoodDiary page, MyFoodList page, Map page, QR Scanner and world foods page. Also, there is the option to sign out on the nav drawer. My food List Can have items manually created and added to it or the user can filter through world foods and add a food Item from that page.

My Food Diary<br>
On this page the user can create a food Item, they enter title and description through edit texts. Simple enough and then users have the choice of selecting an existing picture in the gallery or a new feature that I included is to take their own picture of choice and this then will be stored in firebase DATABASE. Then the user can add location through the Map Activity. This indeed is the activity; I didn't do too much additional work on this page as I wanted to implement other features as to updating stuff that worked well. So, on this map Activity, your location is automatically tracked on the map, but the user can also change the location if they wish, if they remember a location of importance to the foodItem i.e., a shop that it was purchased from. So then add the food and it is stored in the Firebase Real Time DATABASE.<br>

Food Ideas<br>
This page is using the Spoonacular API. It allows a certain number of requests a day on the free plan. I found this API had so many options that were of use for this project. I went with Retrofit for my own application, there was some tweaking on my part though to implement this with spoonacular. I had to research in how to implement headers through Retrofit, I applied it in the client the API key and header name, so then when I'm creating API calls, I didn't have to apply these over every query to the API. I have a filter option on this page, but I had asked a few people in my circle what they think, a filter with many options or just the die-hard stuff of use like what food ideas under a certain number of calories and how many options you want returned from the API.<br>

Testing<br>
A way That I tested my app and got user feedback was to hand my phone around to my family and friends and really use it and test it for me and to give me their feedback. Any feedback I got that was constructive that would make this app function or be more intuitive or user friendly then I implemented it. A clear example of this would be implemented the new feature of taking a photo, this allows the user to take a photo through the app and logging without having to go to camera take a picture and then go back to my food diary and then choose the image, the effort and time consumption of this process. So, it made sense to combine into this app.

Splash screen<br>
I believe I have implemented multi-threading splash screen. As there is no container, fragment, or activity it is implemented as a theme and applied to the login and when login is it ready it will display that activity.,br>

QR Scanner<br>
This feature I wanted to create something a little different that can be of use, especially in these covid vaccination certs times. It was from this that I came up with this idea. I have four QR examples I created that the user can test that are attached to the README.md. So, the user chooses the Scanner from the nav Drawer and then the user scans a QR Code that feeds back the information it contains into a user-friendly format for the user. Once it has been loaded then the user can add it to their food list. This is a nifty little feature that I really enjoyed implementing, the implementation in the Gradle was the ZXing library.

Flow of Project<br>
A splash screen shows, and the user creates or sign up and then is brought automatically after credentials are checked to my food list. The user then can click the FAB button and be brought automatically to my food diary creation of the food object. Other options include hitting the Nav bar and navigating anywhere like the food idea fragment, where the user can set the max number of calories they want to find and how many items they want returned, here they can click on the food item, and it will be added to their own private my food list. Then they can go back to their list and edit or delete. The user can click on maps and see their locations where the food was logged and toggle the switch to see everyoneâ€™s. This feature also exists in my food list. Another cool feature is the barcode/QR code scanner that allows the user to scan codes and add to their food list. It is all built around the food list. You can also sign out from the navbar that will bring you back to the create/login page.

My process<br>
The process that I undertook to complete this project was to follow the labs as the first step and gain knowledge by completing them. My next step do a few tutorials on the camera and the QR code scanner. I did a few more tutorials but it was late, and I didn't have the time to implement, it was the send and share part. So, I created the app and have constantly tested and checked all possible paths and bugs keep coming up, so I am fixing bug by bug. I like to code in my own style, a flow that I can follow and wrap my head around, you might implement something in the labs one way. I take that onboard, but I will try to implement it in my own style.

GitHub Process<br>
The style I used for GitHub, is a feature, develop, release and hotfix. I have used the hot fix technique a bit more than I would like from testing this app. I would create a branch and name it after the feature I was implementing and then pull into the develop branch in this pro_2_stage_one branch some feature examples would be feature_camera or featur_firebase etc. Some stages I would be working on multiple branches depending on which I had an answer come to me, sometimes when training. I would pull them into the branch then pull down and merge conflicts if I needed. I learned this process at work, GitHub is a big part of what I do. The release branch will be the master branch as this is the final product. I have also used tags, would have liked to have used them more appropriately in the first part of the project but they were used correctly for this second part.

MVVM<br>
I used this model in the framework as I thought it would be beneficial to the purpose of being able to click on the individual food item and pass the TIMESTAMP (because firebase uses a String as its id that starts with like -MS121hdj) The time stamp is a long that can be used as ID as it is unique. This is best practice when dealing in real time with firebase database. I created multiple viewModels with different purposes. The most used viewModel is MyFoodListViewModel, I re-used this method to gather the list of food items as to be DRY (don't repeat yourself) I would reference this in whatever fragment I am using and loop through the observable list to withdraw the items or specific item required. every fragment I am using and loop through the observable list to withdraw the items or specific item required. I would create fun methods then that would communicate with the FirebaseManager (where it directly collected data requested) <- only returning Unit form, which is the equivalent of void in java, so it returns nothing just does its computation.

MVP<br>
Along with the MVVM style, I implied the Model View presenter where I believe it suited the project best. This is brilliant for breaking the code out more over connected classes. The activities from the first project would be very large now only for this style along with Fragments and MVVM. Calling view from the constructer in the presenter class and then calling itself the presenter in the view class.  This was the first time I had come across these techniques. MVC was something I worked a lot with but I find the MVVM to be an exceptionally good way of coding, very precise and not a load of waffle of code before it gets to the purpose. 

My own Personal Experience <br>
This was the one class I saw on the curriculum I couldn't wait for, As The app I created in 2017 in WIT set me on a path that I have now accomplished a great job from and still enjoy creating apps as a hobby. I have a really good idea for an app, it is something I have not seen before. I did research and did not find one like it. When I have my final project finished, I will start working on it in the evenings and weekends. I really enjoyed this class both times I have taken it. This was more advanced though than the previous class I undertook in third year in Information Technology. I have never used Kotlin before and I really like it. I am going to have a chat with one of the bosses over the developers at the company and see if these skills I have gained can be used to develop an app from a part of the company, maybe as part of a final project and beyond that. The course was a credit to you both. Excellent support to the students when needed so well done.
